<h1>About Rocky Mountain Decor</h1>
<h2>A Little About its Creator</h2>
<p>My name is Melissa Schaefer and I made Rocky Mountain Decor because creativity has always been a huge part of my life. I have always enjoyed working on craft projects and making something unique from nothing more than a pile of raw materials. I particularly like the rustic flair that makes Rocky Mountain Decor one of a kind because I've spent my life visiting my family's ranch in Montana, and it reminds me of my roots. Aside from creating new products for Rocky Mountain Decor, I enjoy dirt biking, running, camping, fishing and shooting in my spare time.</p>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The purpose of Rocky Mountian Decor is to offer a diverse selection of unique handmade home decor and jewelry that cannot be found anywhere else, all while offereing a competetive price.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
<p>True to its name, Rocky Mountain Decor is located in the midst of the Rocky Mountains, in beautiful Sheridan, Wyoming.
